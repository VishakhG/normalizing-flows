# Normalizing flows

Attempting to implement the potential function experiments from:

```
Danilo Jimenez Rezende and Shakir Mohamed. Variational inference with normalizing
flows. In Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, pages
1530â€“1538, 2015.

```

To reproduce plots run `exp/run_2d_potential_exp.sh` or take a look at `src/fit_flows.py`.
